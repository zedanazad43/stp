   - Required status checks:
     - `build-and-push / build-and-push` (Docker build)

  packages: write     # Push to GitHub Container Registry
  pages: write        # Deploy to GitHub Pages
  id-token: write     # For GitHub Pages deployment
```

### Secrets Configuration

### Private Vulnerability Reporting
- ✅ Enable to allow security researchers to privately report vulnerabilities

---

## Recommended Additional Configurations

### 1. Create CODEOWNERS File

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:
```
# Default owners for everything
* @zedanazad43

# Workflow files
/.github/workflows/ @zedanazad43

# Documentation
*.md @zedanazad43
/docs/ @zedanazad43

# Docker configurations
Dockerfile @zedanazad43
```

### 2. Create Pull Request Template

Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:
```markdown
## Description
<!-- Describe your changes -->

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] I have performed a self-review
- [ ] I have commented my code where necessary
- [ ] I have updated the documentation
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings
- [ ] I have tested my changes
```

### 3. Create Issue Templates

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md`

---

## Push Configuration Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never force push to protected branches**
   ```bash
   # This will fail on main branch (protected)
   git push --force origin main
   ```

2. **Always create feature branches**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Keep commits clean and descriptive**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication module"
   git commit -m "fix: Resolve Docker build issue"
   git commit -m "docs: Update API documentation"
   ```

4. **Sync with main before creating PR**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git rebase main
   ```

### For Repository Owners

1. **Review PR settings regularly**
2. **Update branch protection rules as team grows**
3. **Monitor Actions usage and costs**
4. **Review security alerts weekly**
5. **Keep dependencies updated**

---

## Verification Steps

After configuring these settings:

1. ✅ Try to push directly to main (should be blocked)
2. ✅ Create a test PR and verify status checks run
3. ✅ Verify workflows trigger on push events
4. ✅ Check that GitHub Pages deploys successfully
5. ✅ Verify Docker image builds and pushes to registry

---

## Current Workflow Triggers

All workflows are configured to trigger on push to `main`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

This means:
- ✅ Changes must go through PR process
- ✅ No direct pushes to main (with branch protection)
- ✅ Automated deployments on merge
