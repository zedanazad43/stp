# PR #12 Merge Conflict Resolution

## Overview
This document explains how the merge conflicts in PR #12 were resolved and provides guidance for applying these changes to the original PR branch.

## Problem
PR #12 (`copilot/fix-github-pages-deployment`) had merge conflicts with the `main` branch because:
1. **Action versions**: PR #12 used v2/v3 actions, while main was updated to v4
2. **Conflicting changes**: Both PR #12 and PR #13 (merged to main) modified the same workflow file
3. **Different approaches**: 
   - PR #12: Script-based landing page generation (`scripts/generate-landing-page.sh`)
   - PR #13 (in main): Inline HTML generation in YAML

## Resolution Strategy
The resolution kept the best of both approaches:

### From PR #12 (Preserved):
✅ Script-based landing page generation (`scripts/generate-landing-page.sh`)
✅ Top-level permissions and concurrency configuration
✅ Descriptive step names (e.g., "Checkout repository", "Configure Node.js environment")
✅ Job name: `build-and-deploy`
✅ Clean separation of concerns (HTML in script, not in YAML)

### From main (Adopted):
✅ Updated to v4 actions for all GitHub Actions
✅ New file: `docs/index.html`

## Changes Made

### .github/workflows/deploy.yml
Updated all action versions to v4:
- `actions/checkout@v3` → `actions/checkout@v4`
- `actions/setup-node@v3` → `actions/setup-node@v4`
- `actions/configure-pages@v3` → `actions/configure-pages@v4`
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2` → `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4`
- `actions/deploy-pages@v2` → `actions/deploy-pages@v4`

Maintained PR #12's structure:
- Top-level `permissions` and `concurrency`
- Script-based approach: `bash scripts/generate-landing-page.sh public`
- Descriptive step names

### scripts/generate-landing-page.sh
✅ Preserved as-is from PR #12
- Professional multilingual landing page (Arabic/English/German)
- Stampcoin Platform branding
- Feature cards and API documentation
- Responsive design

## How to Apply to PR #12

The PR author (or maintainer with write access) can apply these changes in one of two ways:

### Option 1: Cherry-pick the changes (Recommended)
```bash
# On the copilot/fix-github-pages-deployment branch
git checkout copilot/fix-github-pages-deployment
git cherry-pick dc45938  # Action version upgrades
git cherry-pick 9817049  # Main branch merge
git push origin copilot/fix-github-pages-deployment --force
```

### Option 2: Merge from this resolution branch
```bash
# On the copilot/fix-github-pages-deployment branch
git checkout copilot/fix-github-pages-deployment
git merge origin/copilot/resolve-pr-12-merge-conflicts
git push origin copilot/fix-github-pages-deployment --force
```

### Option 3: Use this branch directly
Close PR #12 and open a new PR from `copilot/resolve-pr-12-merge-conflicts` to `main`.

## Verification

After applying the changes, verify:
1. ✅ Workflow file syntax is valid
2. ✅ All action versions are v4
3. ✅ `scripts/generate-landing-page.sh` exists and is executable
4. ✅ Permissions include `pages: write` and `id-token: write`
5. ✅ Concurrency control is configured
6. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
