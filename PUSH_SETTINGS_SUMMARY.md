## Repository Push Workflow

### Current Configuration
All workflows trigger on push to `main` branch:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

### Recommended Workflow
1. Contributors create feature branches
2. Make changes and push to feature branch
3. Open pull request to main
4. Automated checks run:
   - Docker build and push
   - Deployment verification  
   - Pages build
5. Code review by CODEOWNERS
6. Merge to main after approval
7. Automated deployment to production

### Branch Protection
With proper settings enabled:
- ❌ **Direct push to main**: Blocked
- ✅ **Push to feature branches**: Allowed
- ✅ **Pull requests to main**: Allowed with checks
- ❌ **Force push**: Not allowed
- ❌ **Branch deletion**: Not allowed

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Features
1. **CODEOWNERS**: Ensures security files reviewed by owner
2. **Branch Protection**: Prevents unauthorized changes
3. **Required Checks**: All builds must pass before merge
4. **Documentation**: Security best practices documented

### Recommended Security Settings
As documented in REPOSITORY_SETTINGS.md:
- Enable Dependabot alerts
- Enable CodeQL analysis
- Enable secret scanning with push protection
- Require signed commits (optional)
- Review security alerts regularly

## Manual Steps Required

### For Repository Owner
1. **Enable Branch Protection** (Settings → Branches):
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Enable "Require pull request before merging"
   - Enable "Require status checks to pass"
   - Add required status checks:
     - `build-and-push / build-and-push`
     - `deploy / deploy`
     - `build / build`

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** (if desired):
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Save configuration

3. **Review and Enable Security Features**:
   - Settings → Code security and analysis
   - Enable all recommended features

4. **Configure Workflow Permissions** (if needed):
   - Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
   - Ensure proper permissions set

## Testing and Verification

### Completed Tests
✅ Code review: No issues found
✅ Security scan: No vulnerabilities (documentation only)
✅ File structure: All templates in correct locations
✅ Documentation: Comprehensive and accurate

### How to Test After Merge
1. Try to push directly to main (should fail)
2. Create test PR from feature branch
3. Verify CODEOWNERS auto-assigned as reviewer
4. Verify PR template appears
5. Create test issue and verify templates appear
6. Verify workflows trigger on merge to main
